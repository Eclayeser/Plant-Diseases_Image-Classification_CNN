# Plant-Diseases_Image-Classification_CNN

Our aim is to classify plant diseases from leaf images using a PyTorch CNN and a Gradio interface.
The repository currently contains a project skeleton, with purpose comments to guide future implementation.

Shared Python code belongs in `leafapp/`, the interface in `app/`, and configuration files in `configs/`.
The `train.py` and `evaluate.py` files are entry points for training and evaluating the model.
The `notebooks/`, `tests/`, and `docs/` folders hold exploratory work, automated checks, and project documentation.

The prototype and final product will share the same codebase.
Prototype settings will be kept in `configs/prototype.yaml`, and ClearML tags will identify prototype runs.
A `v0.1-prototype` Git tag will mark the version delivered as the prototype.
